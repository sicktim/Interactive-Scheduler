TODO List for Refinements:

1.  [ ] **Fix Time Scale Labels**: Change column header time labels from "06, 09..." to "6, 9...".
2.  [ ] **Integrate Time Scale**: Ensure time scale numbers are visually distinct but clearly inside the header cell (bottom aligned).
3.  [ ] **Fix Row Backgrounds**: 
    *   Remove background/border styling from the inner React component `div`.
    *   Apply styling only to the outer Grid cell `div`.
    *   Ensure inner `div` has `h-full` and `min-height` (calculated) to push the row height but expand to fill neighbors.
4.  [ ] **Implement 2D Scroll with Sticky Headers**:
    *   Set `body` to `overflow: hidden`.
    *   Make the main container `h-screen` and `flex flex-col`.
    *   Make the `.gantt-container` `overflow: auto` (handling both X and Y scroll).
    *   Ensure headers stick to the top of `.gantt-container`.
    *   Ensure name column sticks to the left of `.gantt-container`.
