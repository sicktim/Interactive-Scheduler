                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  My desired end state (long term): A fully deployed web-hosted schedule user interface and backend database to schedule events, people, assets within constraints of crew size, academic prerequisites, crew qualifications. Will be used to communicate to staff/students their personalized daily/weekly flying  
  schdeules. Will also be used simultaneously by schedulers to schedule events and track completion. Will not have any connection to Whiteboard 2.0 or google sheets or google apps scripts. It will be developed with enough infrastructure to enable later optimization algorithms to automate the scheduling     
  process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  Near-term end state: A scheduling tool that displays whiteboard 2.0 in various forms (timeline, rainbow, listed event-focused) to assist scheduling/deconflicting people and assets.
